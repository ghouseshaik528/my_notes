//HTML and CSS

//in HTMl while giving id or classes

	id    =    "first"
attribute		Attribute Value

Note: In HTML we can only have one 'id' of same name, no duplicates names are allowed.
		But we can have same class names as many as we want.

//While in CSS it will be called as

	color  :   red;
  property	  property-value

#id attributes---------.class attributes--------div attributes

Example for demostration:
-------------------------
HTML file:												CSS file:
----------												---------
<div class="some-class">							#one{ Color:red; }
	<p>Some <span id="one">Text</span></p>			.some-class { color:blue; }
</div>

//So the first preference will be given to 'id' attribute and then to 'class' attribute.

//When we have nested classes in our code for example
HTML file:
----------
<article class="one two"> 	//Note:When we give space in class attribute values it will consider as two classes
	<section class="three">
		Some Text
	</section>
Another text
<footer>....</footer>
</article>

CSS file:
---------
.one.two{ color:red; } 			//this line will make the 'complete article' red
.one.two .three{ color:blue; }	//this line will only make the 'section' blue
